Control your pellet stove! With the adafruit ESP8266 feather with a latching relay feather wing

This could be used to control anything with a relay really over MQTT.

Requires an mqtt broker that you can connect to.

Also needs a credentials.h file with WLAN_SSID, WLAN_PASS, SERVER, SERVER_PORT, MQTT_USER, and MQTT_PASS defined in it.
